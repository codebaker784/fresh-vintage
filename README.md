# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# DVT Tech Challenge
This challenge is part of the hiring process at DVT for frontend developer roles. The objective is to produce this without investing any more time than necessary. As such, we'd like to see your regular conventions when writing an application.

## Why are we asking you to do this?
At DVT, we try to set our standards high. We would love for strong candidates to join our team and help us aim to be the best. This challenge is to help us understand your proficiency over a number of facets of development, which we value.

Some of these are
- Good commit & branching conventions
- Handling of network requests
- Typescript
- Routing
- State management
- Framework (Angular or React) conventions
- Semantic HTML
- CSS and general ability to produce a polished end result  - responsiveness is low priority, but appreciated

## What do you need to produce?
We're asking you to build a basic storefront using [[https://fakestoreapi](https://fakestoreapi.com/)](Fake Store API)

We would like for you to get all products and display them as cards on a page, with the ability to add items to a cart.

There is a _lot_ of room to go above the expected outcome, and please feel free to tackle something that is relevant to your current level (this would be optional)

_Some_ examples of this would be 
- Using a global state manager in an efficient way
- Multiple routes
- Great visuals

## Some additional notes
- Please be considerate of what dependencies and build tools you are using
- If you opt to use any @ts-ignores or similar, please leave a comment with an explanation
- Feel free to leave comments/notes in your readme.md

## Submission
Please use this repo as your submission as a finalised pull request and notify us when you are complete.
